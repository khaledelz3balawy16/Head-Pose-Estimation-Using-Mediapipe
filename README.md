With a passion for developing innovative solutions and analyzing complex data, Khaled focuses on applying advanced techniques to real-world problems. In this notebook, Khaled explores head pose estimation using the Mediapipe library, showcasing how modern computer vision tools can be utilized for precise and efficient analysis of head orientation.

Introduction: Head Pose Estimation Using Mediapipe
In this notebook, we demonstrate how to estimate head pose using the Mediapipe library, developed by Google for advanced computer vision applications. The primary objective of this code is to compute three key angles of head orientation: roll, pitch, and yaw from a collection of images.

Overview of Mediapipe
Mediapipe is a versatile framework provided by Google, designed to facilitate the development of computer vision and machine learning applications. It includes a variety of pre-trained models that can perform tasks such as face detection, hand tracking, and pose estimation with high accuracy.

Purpose of This Code
Setup and Installation:

Libraries: We start by importing necessary libraries: cv2 for image processing, mediapipe for analyzing facial landmarks, numpy for numerical operations, and pandas for managing data.
Installing Mediapipe: If Mediapipe is not already available, we use pip to install it.
Initialize Mediapipe FaceMesh:

We configure the FaceMesh model from Mediapipe to detect and analyze facial landmarks from the images provided.
Load and Process Images:

Image Directory: We specify the path to the folder containing the images and list all relevant image files.
Angle Calculation: For each image, we compute the roll, pitch, and yaw angles by analyzing facial landmarks extracted by the FaceMesh model.
Store and Save Results:

Data Storage: We compile the results into a DataFrame, which includes the image filenames along with the computed angles.
Export Data: Finally, we save the DataFrame as a CSV file to the /kaggle/working/ directory, making it available for download and further analysis.
Code Functionality
Library Initialization: We set up all required libraries and tools.
Image Handling: Images are loaded from the specified directory for analysis.
Pose Estimation: Head pose angles are computed for each image using Mediapipe's FaceMesh model.
Data Management: Results are stored in a DataFrame and saved as a CSV file for ease of access.
This notebook provides a streamlined approach to head pose estimation, utilizing advanced computer vision techniques to derive meaningful orientation data from facial images.
